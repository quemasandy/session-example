================================================================================

Additional Educational Use Notice:

This software is specifically designed for educational purposes to demonstrate
session-based authentication concepts. It includes:

1. Simplified authentication for learning (not production-ready)
2. Extensive logging and debugging features for educational value
3. Comprehensive documentation explaining session management concepts
4. Redis monitoring tools for understanding session storage

When using this software for educational purposes:
- The code is intentionally verbose with educational comments
- Security implementations are simplified for clarity
- Production hardening is not included by design
- Focus is on demonstrating concepts rather than performance

For production use, additional security measures would be required including:
- Proper password hashing
- Rate limiting
- CSRF protection
- Input validation and sanitization
- Security headers
- Audit logging
- And other production security practices

Educational institutions and instructors are encouraged to use this software
for teaching web authentication concepts, with proper attribution to the
original contributors.
